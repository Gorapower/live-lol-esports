# Vite Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration of the Live LoL Esports application from Create React App (CRA) to Vite + React 18.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Setup
- ✅ Created a new git branch `feat/vite-migration-part1`
- ✅ Moved the original CRA code to the `legacy/` directory
- ✅ Bootstrapped a new Vite + React 18 project in the root directory
- ✅ Configured Vite with the appropriate base path for GitHub Pages (`/live-lol-esports/`)

### 2. Dependencies
- ✅ Installed required dependencies:
  - `react-router-dom@^6` (upgraded from v5)
  - `axios`
  - `react-helmet`
  - `react-toastify`
  - `use-sound`
  - `bignumber.js`
  - `gh-pages`
  - `vite-plugin-svgr` (for SVG imports)

### 3. Code Migration
- ✅ Updated React 18 root rendering with `createRoot` in `main.tsx`
- ✅ Migrated from React Router v5 to v6:
  - Replaced `BrowserRouter` with `HashRouter` for GitHub Pages compatibility
  - Replaced `Switch` with `Routes`
  - Updated `Route component` to `Route element`
  - Replaced `useHistory` with `useNavigate`
  - Updated `useParams` usage
- ✅ Fixed SVG imports to work with Vite using `vite-plugin-svgr`
- ✅ Updated TypeScript configuration to be compatible with Vite
- ✅ Added type declarations for Vite-specific features

### 4. Localization
- ✅ Changed API requests from Portuguese (`pt-BR`) to English (`en-US`)
- ✅ Translated UI strings from Portuguese to English
- ✅ Updated number formatting from `pt-br` to `en-US`

### 5. Environment Variables
- ✅ Migrated from `REACT_APP_*` to Vite's format
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
- ✅ Updated README with environment variable usage

### 6. Build & Deployment
- ✅ Updated build scripts in `package.json`:
  - `dev` - Start the development server
  - `build` - Build the app for production
  - `preview` - Preview the production build locally
  - `predeploy` - Build before deployment
  - `deploy` - Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Successfully built the application with Vite
- ✅ Verified the production build works with `preview`

## Documentation
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with comprehensive documentation about the new Vite setup
- ✅ Added migration notes and key changes
- ✅ Updated `legacy/README.md` with instructions for running the old CRA version

## Key Changes

### Build Tool
- **From**: Create React App
- **To**: Vite

### React Version
- **From**: React 17
- **To**: React 18

### Router
- **From**: React Router v5
- **To**: React Router v6 with HashRouter

### Locale
- **From**: Portuguese (pt-BR)
- **To**: English (en-US)

### Environment Variables
- **From**: `REACT_APP_*`
- **To**: `VITE_*` with `import.meta.env.VITE_*`

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly to ensure full feature parity
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages using the `npm run deploy` script
3. Verify all deep links work correctly with HashRouter
4. Consider migrating Portuguese audio clips to English equivalents
5. Perform a sanity check on the legacy CRA app to ensure it still runs

## Known Issues

1. Some TypeScript errors related to JSX types may still exist but don't prevent the build
2. Portuguese audio clips still need to be replaced with English equivalents

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Faster Development**: Vite provides significantly faster development server startup and hot module replacement
2. **Smaller Bundle Size**: Vite's optimized bundling results in smaller production builds
3. **Modern Tooling**: Access to the latest ecosystem tools and plugins
4. **Better DX**: Improved developer experience with more intuitive configuration
5. **Future-proof**: The app is now using modern React patterns and tooling

## Conclusion

The migration from Create React App to Vite has been completed successfully. The application now uses modern tooling, has better performance, and is ready for future development. The legacy CRA version has been preserved in the `legacy/` directory for reference if needed.
